# **Ian's Grocery Store**
Application that the customer can use to order groceries, and the employees and managers can use to operate the store.

## Detailed Description

The application that the customer will use will display pages of products that they can cycle through. They can choose to get more information on the products, or add the product to their cart. There will also be a specials menu at the bottom of the screen what will take up less space, but work in a similar fashion. The employees and managers will each have their own applications as well that they must log into, but these applications will be used for them to perform their respective duties.
